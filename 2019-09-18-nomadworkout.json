Built with NodeJS, MongoDB, and ReactJS. \n\nUsers can search the database of cities, contact city guides, become city guides and add tips. On each city you can view popular routes, current athletes, nutrition, groups, and tips. Users can also sort cities by certain parameters and by monthly weather data to find new places to visit that match the environment they enjoy working out in. \n\nThe objective is to create a global community of athletes that support eachother travel. \n\nThere is an on-demand service that contacts weather data and Strava information on the fly, compiles the data, creates a city and returns JSON data that gives an overview of athlete activities. This can take just 3 seconds to achieve. \n\nSecurity and spamming are combatted with with data sanitisation, Google reCaptcha, and passport authentication on all routes that access the main data stores.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/portfolio/2019-09-18-nomadworkout.md","sha":"1aa1ee4bd0187c7b4dd5c6e969b9be48e9ef1c09"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-10-10T20:44:20.878Z"}
