intro: >-
  A Simon Game built with JQuery and Vanilla JS with timing events and simple
  UI.
description: >-
  An independent front-end project to test my JavaScript and JQuery skills, this
  Simon game creates a set of lighting and sound events that users have to
  emulate. It uses custom css animation and styling of components with each
  progression in the game. There are a variety of user options, and the game
  interval decreases in sections of play, making the game more difficult
  throughout. Go on, have a play, if you get to 20 you win!
features: |-
  * JQuery and JavaScript to control user interaction and game events.
  * CSS animations and transitions for game display changes.
  * Use of functional programming to create simple and easy to read code.
  * User interface bright, easy to follow and navigate.
