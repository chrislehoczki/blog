  globe and shows relationships between all your followers.

  force-directed graphs. Once logged in, users followers are collated. An API
  call collates their relationships with other users and a force-directed graph
  is created showing the relationships within your athlete community. The next
  process geocodes user locations server side using Google Geocoding API, and
  then uses D3 mapping and topoJSON to display a users followers on an
  interactive global map.
