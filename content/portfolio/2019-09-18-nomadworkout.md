  An athlete community app built with Node, React, and Mongo. With over 650
  cities, city guides, and tips.  
description: >-
  NomadWorkout is blazingly fast. Built with NodeJS, MongoDB, ReactJS and with
  OOP principles applied throughout. Users can search the database of cities,
  contact city guides, become city guides and add tips. On each city you can
  view popular routes, current athletes, nutrition, groups, and tips. Users can
  also sort cities by certain parameters and by monthly weather data to find new
  places to visit that match the environment they enjoy working out in. The
  objective is to create a global community of athletes that support eachother
  travel. There is an on-demand service that contacts weather data and Strava
  information on the fly, compiles the data, creates a city and returns JSON
  data that gives an overview of athlete activities. This can take just 3
  seconds to achieve. Security and spamming are combatted with with data
  sanitisation, Google reCaptcha, and passport authentication on all routes that
  access the main data stores.
