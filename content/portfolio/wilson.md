intro: A meditative voice journalling experiment
description: >-
  As part of a 3 day process in conjunction with MinimumBadass Finland and the
  Songhi core team, we outlined, created, and evaluated a new concept for a
  mobile app.


  The mobile app concept is simple. Choose a time of day to think deeply about a
  topic that interests you, and then record a 1 minute snippet of your thoughts.
  Collate them, share them, and listen to others' inspiring thoughts on the same
  topics. You can also follow a pathway for self development with thought
  provoking questions.


  We built the prototype in React with the preliminary plan to convert to React
  Native if we chose to go ahead.
features: |-
  * An exploratory conference for creating new ideas and products
  * Team building, product creation, and evaluation process
