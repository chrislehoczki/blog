intro: >-
  A game builder for primary school children and teachers to create their own
  learning games without coding
description: >-
  Builder was created to enable school children to have the freedom to play and
  create their own learning games to share with their teachers and classmates. 


  A drag and drop interface, a customisable UI, and the ability to add multiple
  roles to different objects within the game created the possibilities for a
  multitude of learning game types. 


  Success within Hong Kong and Finland made it quite popular within early years
  education, especially for teachers that wanted to create learning games that
  were part of the curriculum.


  On the frontend we used React for the UI, css web animations, and the Web
  Audio API for interactive and immersive experiences. 


  For the backend we had a Node, Express, MongoDB for user profiles, saving
  games, and sharing them with the world.
