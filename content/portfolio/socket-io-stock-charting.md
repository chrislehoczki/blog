intro: 'A real time stock sharing app using websockets with Socket.io, React, and D3.'
description: >-
  This app uses NodeJS, React, Socket.io and D3 to allow multiple users to share
  stock data wherever they are in the world. Websockets allow any update to be
  shared with every user connected at the same time. Animation using D3 makes
  the transitions of adding new data seamless with a re-render of the graph
  scales and axes based on all data provided. An intelligent graphing tool that
  responds to data interactively. The app uses a stocks API to retrieve stock
  prices for the current month for any share index.

  * NodeJS server with Express and Socket.io for real time data sharing
  * ReactJS for dynamically updating data on client side.
  * D3JS for charting and animations on data entry.
