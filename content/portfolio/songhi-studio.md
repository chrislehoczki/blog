intro: 'A music studio, like Garage Band, but in your browser!'
description: >-
  Songhi Studio was a HTML based music studio for students to learn the basics
  of music composition and create their own tracks. Users can create their own
  compositions with a simple to use interface of adding beats to a grid, or
  choose from a variety of premade patterns. A huge collection of curated
  instruments enable users to create an unlimited variety of tracks from a range
  of genres. Sound effects are available to make some funky tunes even better.
  Users can also create their own instruments by recording their own samples and
  even make 'magic' instruments using just their voice and pitch shifting. 


  We used some bleeding edge technology on this project. Web workers for audio
  processing and timing. Advanced Web Audio API including sound effects and
  rendering MP3s from song data right there in the browser! The UI was built in
  React, with Redux for state management.
