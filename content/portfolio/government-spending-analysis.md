  An analysis and visual interpretation of UK Labour vs Conservative party
  spending and debt repayment
description: >-
  A D3 interactive analysis of the past 70 years of public spending and debt
  repayment by the UK Conservative and Labour governments. This analysis took
  Richard Murphy's interesting but difficult to access historical spending
  analysis, and turned it into an interactive exploration with a great user
  interface. D3JS was used for data representation, animations, with JQuery for
  dynamic text content.
features: |-
  D3JS bar charts and interactive visualisations

  JQuery and JavaScript for dynamic text content

  JSON to hold data for representation

  Excellent user interface and functional modern styling
