  A nightlife coordination app built with ReactJS, NodeJS and Express. Track
  nightlife and find the best bars in your area.
description: >-
  Built with the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs. This full
  stack app uses the FourSquare API for users to track local bars and view the
  numbers of people going on a particular evening. Users can add themselves and
  remove themselves from bars as they wish. A statement of simplicity, the app
  requires a user to input their location before accessing anything, making the
  app easy to understand and use. The beauty of the app is its universality.
  Anyone in the world can search for their local bars and add themselves to
  them, making it a truly global app.
