  A responsive booking site for running camps in the heart of the Himalayas.
  Build with Node for lightning fast page loads and a Ghost blog which far
  outreaches any other CMS for speed. Instagram API integration on page load and
  custom designed overlays add to a very simple and easy to use user interface.
  The site was built on node to allow for further integrations of custom booking
  systems, race organisation, and charity running projects throughout Nepal. The
  Ghost blog has been connected with an Amazon S3 account for permanent file
  storage using the S3 SDK. EJS is used a the main templating engine for server
  side rendering. The project files are bundled with Grunt which also compiles
  ES6 and SASS.
