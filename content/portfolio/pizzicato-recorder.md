intro: A recording extension module for PizzicatoJS
description: >-
  During my work at Songhi I learnt about recording audio data and encoding this
  in WAV and MP3 format. The Pizzicato library users were interested in an
  extension so I wrote a simple module that collects audio data in a web worker
  and writes it out to a WAV file.


  It's a simple extension that adds some new methods to the Pizzicato object
  which is exported from the main library.
features: |-
  * Web worker for audio processing from the master node
  * Works with all sounds, effects, and groups
  * WAV encoding 
  * Downloading right in the browser
