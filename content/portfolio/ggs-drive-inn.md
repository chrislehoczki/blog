  A cafe promotion site for GGs Drive Inn, Manitoba, Canada. Built from scratch
  with the "_s" theme from Automattic using SASS preprocessor with backrops of
  local food and an interactive full page navigation menu. The site is single
  page with a responsive navbar coded in vanilla JavaScript. Each section is
  navigable quickly and easily an on smaller devices the navigation will be
  optional with a menu button for transition animation. The customer wanted to
  update the specials part of the site monthly, so intensive training was given
  on the Wordpress dashboard and updating posts and pages.
