  We have more mental health dialogue than ever in modern society. It’s
    increasingly talked about openly amongst friends, especially with at risk
    groups such as young men. 

    I have been surprised by the number of mental health conversations I have had
    whilst out running and cycling. There is definitely a significant number of
    recreational athletes that use their passion to become more resilient to
    mental health setbacks.

    Aerobic exercise can mitigate symptoms, facilitate recovery from, and prevent
    relapse of mental health conditions. This article will explore the myriad of
    ways that putting one foot in front of the other can do this. But first, let’s
    define our terms.

  ## The Global Rise of Mental Health Conditions

    Mental health is a broad topic. 

    In general we can say that positive mental health allows us to function in
    society, have meaningful relationships with those we love, energy to follow
    our passions, and hope for the future.

    Conditions such as depression and anxiety can interfere with our ability to
    lead fulfilled lives. We can think of depression as profound sadness, fatigue,
    altered sleep and appetite, with feelings of guilt or low self worth. Anxiety
    can cause excessive fear of normal social situations, obsessive compulsive
    behaviours, distrust and inability to sustain relationships with others. 

    It’s important to note that mental health conditions lie on a spectrum.
    Feeling glum, sad, or nervous for a while is completely normal and part of
    experiencing a range of healthy human emotions. This is not the same as
    clinical depression which can involve changed hormone production, metabolic
    systems, inflammatory responses and immune functions. It can last months,
    years, or even a lifetime. This post is written in the hope that it is
    relevant to all people.

    Mental health problems are not improving. Between 2005 and 2015 the rates of
    depression increased by more than 18%. The World Health Organisation currently
    estimates that 322 million people, 4% of the global population, are suffering
    with depression. As Stephen Fry rightly points out, this is not a case of 1st
    World Problems, the rates of mental health issues are similar across all
    wealth groups worldwide.

    Those with mental health conditions suffer a range of other problems. Lower
    lifespan, obesity, addiction, and chronic health conditions are just a few. 

    Current treatments for depression include prescription drugs, especially
    SSRI’s (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). As Johann Hair points out in
    The Lost Connections, the evidence for the link between serotonin and
    depression is highly controversial. The response to treatment is variable and
    remission rates are high. 

    Prominent thinkers in the mental health field are now looking to alternative
    treatments for mental health conditions, such as diet and exercise. 

    Aerobic exercise can create drastic changes in people’s mood, recovery and
    resiliency to mental health conditions. 

  ## Exercise and Mental Health


  ## Stress and Inflammation: Removing Toxins and Protecting the Brain

    Those with depression have a consistent level of low grade chronic
    inflammation. There is a clear link between the production of stress hormones,
    common in mental health conditions, and inflammation.

    When we are not stressed and suffering from chronic inflammation, we are able
    to use a compound called **tryptophan** and convert it into **serotonin**.
    This is essential for regulating mood and cognition.

    This is not what happens with those suffering from mental health conditions
    and inflammation. Instead, **tryptophan** converts into a substance called
    kynurenine and **quinolinic acid**, which is actually a neurotoxin. It causes
    the death and disease of brain cells and the normal functioning of the brain.

    Aerobic exercise prevents the production of **quinolinic acid** and instead
    creates an enzyme that converts tryptophan to **kynurenic acid**. This is
    actually neuroprotective and supports the brain's normal functioning. 

  ![Excellent diagram from  foundmyfitness.com illustrating how exercise changes
  tryptophan metabolism](/assets/kynurenine-metabolism-exercise.png "Excellent
  diagram from  foundmyfitness.com illustrating how exercise changes tryptophan
  metabolism")

    Running changes the way our body metabolises tryptophan. It prevents the
    production of toxins in the brain, and swaps it over for a substance which is
    protective.

  ## Brain Health: Creating New Connections and Remodelling the Brain

    Chronic inflammation is bad for the brain. It prevents the production of
    serotonin, but with exercise we can mitigate some of the effects. 

    Exercise produces short term acute inflammation which is different from this
    chronic inflammation. It actively supports the growth of new cells in the
    brain.

    When we exercise, our muscles create **myokines**. These stimulate brain cells
    to produce molecules that support the healthy condition and production of more
    neutrons in the brain and are beneficial for the central nervous system. These
    are called neurotrophic factors. One example is BDNF (Brain Derived
    Neurotrophic Factor) that is produced through exercise. Those under high
    stress and those with clinical depression have less of this. Exercise can make
    up for that shortfall.

    Creating new neutrons in the brain literally allows us the space to think
    differently. It opens up new avenues for self reflection and joins things
    together in ways we weren’t able to previously. 

    Suffering from mental health conditions can often feel like being stuck in a
    rut. You can’t escape negative thought patterns or the enduring mental and
    physical fatigue. 

    By creating substances like BDNF through exercise we can support psychological
    recovery and resilience.

  ## Euphoria: Happy Molecules :smile:

    Oh the runners' high…….. That feeling of balance and total comfort in the
    world when you come back from a long workout. 

    There are two types of molecule that cause this euphoric feeling.

    **Cannabonoids** are found both inside and outside of the body and are
    produced during aerobic exercise. Outside the body these molecules include THC
    and CBD, commonly found in marijuana. Inside the body they are called
    endocannabonoids  They bind to receptors on cells throughout the body and in
    the brain, creating feelings of well being and reducing sensations of anxiety.
    They are produced spectacularly well between 70-80% of maximum heart rate,
    also correlated with [zone 2
    training](https://www.runbikecode.com/blog/zone-2-training-for-fell-runners-1/).

    **Beta-endorphins** are the other happy molecule. These bind to opioid
    receptors in cells, reduce stress and increase the body’s ability to maintain
    a positive internal environment. They help with the management of pain, as a
    reward to the body, and help maintain stable behaviour patterns.

    It’s clear that endocannabinoids offer a short term fix which can be helpful
    for the management of mental health conditions. Beta endorphins support the
    body to maintain a productive metabolic environment and help to reward the
    body for maintaining stability in hormone levels. Taking control over your
    body and mind and keeping internal systems stable is a key element of
    recovering from mental health issues.

  ## Body Temperature: Run Like The Finns Do Sauna, Or Ice Like The Iceman

    People with depression have higher body temperatures on average. Anxiety can
    cause rapid fluctuations in body temperature that are difficult to control. 

    **Lowering Body Temperature**

    For those with depression, it can be helpful to systematically lower the body
    temperature through exposure to higher temperatures. 

    A study has found that one dose of heat treatment in a sauna can help lower
    body temperatures as the body adapts. Participants in the study noted fewer
    symptoms of depression up to six weeks after only one exposure. 

    Exercise increases body temperature for short periods of time, and mimics how
    sauna was used in the study. I’d be very interested to see a study of aerobic
    exercise, long term body temperature changes and mental health. 

  ![Raising body  temperature repeatedly leads to a lowering of daily body
  temperature and may  help with
  depression](/assets/jonathan-forage-kb9kzgmxgdu-unsplash.jpg "Raising body 
  temperature repeatedly leads to a lowering of daily body temperature and may 
  help with depression")

    **Gaining Control of Body Temperature**

    It was previously thought that we were unable to control our autonomic nervous
    system. This regulates important bodily processes such as heart rate,
    digestion, respiratory rate, and urination. High heart rate, body temperature,
    digestive problems, rapid breathing, and frequent urination are all symptoms
    of anxiety. 

    Wim Hof, aka the Ice Man, has been using cold exposure to help him [control
    his autonomic nervous system](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/science). He is
    able to control his own body temperature and immune system response through
    his practice of immersing himself in ice. So mindfulness during exposure to
    stressors on the autonomic nervous system can support the conscious control of
    body temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate.

  ![Taking an ice bath in Finland was an
  experience!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-Pe9nA6mQ =800x600 "Taking an
  ice bath in Finland was an experience!")

    When we exercise, we expose our body to stress on the autonomic nervous system
    like above. How much higher is your heart rate at races due to adrenaline and
    excitement? It’s possible to consciously lower that heart rate and perform
    better. For those that suffer from anxiety, aerobic exercise offers a pathway
    where we can learn to better control our autonomic nervous system and not be a
    slave to the fight or flight mechanism.

  ## Sleep: Restructuring The Circadian Rhythm

    The circadian rhythm is our daily sleep and wake times, alongside our food
    intake and our peak productions of various stress hormones. Everyone is
    different, but those with depressive conditions often have disturbances in
    this sleep-wake cycle. They produce stress hormones at different times, and
    their internal clocks are often misaligned to light and darkness.

    Exercise plays a strong role in the management of the circadian rhythm.
    Exercising at a similar time every day, alongside eating correctly, can
    promote the development of a strong sleep and waking cycle. Exercise also
    creates fatigue which supports healthy sleep patterns.

    Timed exercise can help people sleep better and maintain a stable circadian
    rhythm. This helps keep the production of stress hormones consistent and
    support the better management of mental health symptoms.

  ## Diet: Fuelling The Right Way

    Diet has a huge role to play in the management, prevention, and treatment of
    mental health conditions. 

    Those that eat a standard Western diet with a high amount of processed food
    have higher risks of developing anxiety and depression, whereas those that eat
    more fruits and vegetables report higher levels of mental wellbeing.

    Fried foods, alcohol, and high amounts of sugar all cause oxidative stress.
    These have been shown to prevent the production of new neurons in the brain.
    It’s difficult to recover from a mental health condition if you are unable to
    create neuronal pathways to think differently and make new connections.

    When you exercise you quickly become attuned to what your body needs. It’s
    very hard to go for a run when you’ve just eaten McDonalds. When you come back
    from a workout your body wants fresh food, and if you don’t get the right
    nutrients you will soon learn that you can’t manage the fatigue. 

    Fasted training is a common form of training amongst recreational and elite
    athletes alike. It involves not eating for longer workouts in order to give
    more stimulus for improvement. I wrote an article about it
    [here](https://www.runbikecode.com/blog/fasted-training-for-distance-runners/).
    This simulates so called intermittent fasting, where you don’t eat for a
    certain part of the day. There is considerable evidence that intermittent
    fasting can help with mental health conditions. These benefits could well
    apply to fasted training.

    Exercising promotes eating a good diet, which can help with the production of
    new brain cells and heightened levels of mental wellbeing. Further, if you
    practice fasted training, there is some evidence that this will also help with
    symptoms.

  ## Bridging The Gap: Disconnection From The Body and The Self

    It’s hard to describe depersonalisation to someone that hasn’t experienced it.
    It is a condition that sometimes accompanies anxiety. It’s a detachment from
    the self; a feeling like you are just an observer of what’s happening around
    you rather than directly experiencing it. It is also a detachment from the
    body. You are unable to connect with your bodily processes and sensations can
    feel different or even totally numb.

    People on the spectrum of mental health conditions can feel this in various
    ways. It is not uncommon for PTSD survivors to feel a disconnection from their
    body. Those that experience chronic stress are also unable to slow down for a
    period of time to check with how their body is feeling.

    Exercise connects the mind and body. Through the repetitive motion of moving
    your entire self, you get an intimate knowledge of the bones, muscles and
    joints and how they are working together. Such small repetitive actions can be
    hypnotic and allow us to really feel what is going on inside. 

    Those that exercise come to fully understand their body under stress. They
    know when to push, when to hold back, how long they can hold certain efforts.
    They also know when to take it easy to avoid injury or when to push when the
    body is feeling good. 

    Such an intimate relationship with the body is the absolute opposite of what
    depersonalisation is. Exercise can help us regain control of the mind-body
    connection and counter symptoms of anxiety and chronic stress.

  ## Nature Works

    We are disconnected from the natural world.

    I say that without the use of the words ‘some of us’. 

    Jobs which don’t allow us much daylight, use of electronic devices during
    recreational and social time, and children staying predominantly indoors is
    the norm.

    Exercise creates the momentum to leave the house and experience the world
    around us. 

    It helps us foster a very intimate relationship with nature. 

    New routes are carved out in the landscape where every outing is a mini
    adventure. It’s a creative process. It’s a natural process. It’s something
    we’ve lost. 

    Spending time outside for therapeutic benefits is called ecotherapy. It
    improves mood, reduces feelings of stress or anger, and help you take time out
    to feel more relaxed. Giving time for yourself and your chosen method of
    exercise is giving you time to rebuild those energy reserves, ready to come
    back and face the issues that are present in daily life.

    Getting outside can also help with Seasonal Affective Disorder by getting more
    light exposure. This also has the effect of keeping the circadian rhythm under
    control.

  ## Joining The Community: Collaboration and Respect

    Mental health issues can be isolating. It can be hard to create new
    relationships and maintain the ones you have. Feeling a lack of self worth, of
    being an annoyance or chore to be around, hinders people's ability to
    socialise effectively. This can exacerbate the issues surrounding the original
    problem.

    Running and cycling clubs are everywhere. Almost all have an inclusive and
    barrier free entry policy. You can just turn up and spend time with kind
    people that are willing to support both in the sport and outside of it. Many
    have social events and maintain a big social group outside of the exercise
    focus.

    It’s not just finding new friends but also the culture of respect and feeling
    of belonging to a club. There is something tribal about feeling supported and
    supporting others to do the thing they love. 

    Counteracting social isolation, feeling like you belong, and gaining respect
    from others are all key parts of maintaining positive mental health.

  ![Exercising with  a club counteracts social isolation

  ## Being Heard: Talking With Movement

    It can be hard to talk openly. When you are anxious of social situations it
    can be difficult to initiate a conversation, let alone have the enjoyable
    feeling of being in sync with someone and really getting along.

    Exercising with other people takes the awkwardness away. 

    To begin with, you are all there with a mutual love of the same thing. You are
    also all moving together and focusing on something which is totally outside of
    the conversation. There is no judgement and barriers are dissolved. There are
    openers to conversation with talks about races, training methods and favourite
    places to go. 

    Once you’ve got the conversation started, it is amazing how many people are
    actually open to discussing mental health challenges. A lot of people with
    mental health issues use exercise in the ways outlined above. You will find
    people from all walks of life, experiencing life’s most difficult challenges.
    You can talk about your own experience, and learn so much from the experiences
    of others.

    Being heard and learning from others are skills that can be developed and can
    be transferred to other areas of life. Other social avenues can open up and
    new connections can be made.

  ## Self Improvement: Getting Stronger In Both Body And Mind

    Many mental health conditions can feel as if they are static and just aren’t
    improving. It’s hard to see the incremental improvements one can make. The ups
    and downs of recovering from a mental illness are hard to put into a structure
    where you can see a trajectory to feeling better.

    With exercise you can see notable improvements straight away. 

    Exercise gets easier very quickly once you get started. Within weeks you feel
    a difference in fitness.

    Your body changes as you lose weight and gain muscle mass. 

    Your resting heart rate lowers and daily activities become easier.

    This momentum can help to think more about the mental health journey. Setting
    goals and seeing progress are a huge part of recovery from mental illness and
    also a way of maintaining positive mental health.

    With aerobic exercise, there is the concept of periodisation. This means
    having harder workouts followed by easier ones which allow your body to
    recover. Using this concept outside of training is a real skill. If you have a
    hard day at work one day, consider going easier the next day to allow yourself
    to recover. If you had some triggers for anxiety one day and successfully
    overcame them, congratulate yourself and reduce your exposure to the same
    amount of triggers the next day. Actively planning your mental health recovery
    and management is essential for long term success.

    Think of mental health recovery like training. You need to stress your body in
    just the right amounts to see improvements. This is called progressive
    overload. As you continue to add more stress, you will be able to cope with
    more. This will make you stronger and reinforce any mental health strategies
    you have.

  ## Conclusion

    If you are suffering from a mental health condition, it’s important that you
    speak to your GP or health practitioner and get in touch with those that love
    and support you. Nothing said in this article can replace those two hugely
    important factors. 

    I also don’t want to suggest that prescription medication doesn’t have a
    place. It definitely does and for some people it works wonders.

    I do feel that exercise is looked down upon as a ‘soft’ treatment option. But
    the science is there to support the metabolic changes it fosters, as well as
    the improvements in feelings of community integration and self development.
    It’s one tool in a big arsenal for combatting mental health conditions and
    fostering positive mental wellbeing.
