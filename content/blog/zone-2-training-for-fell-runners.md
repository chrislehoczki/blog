  Stuck in a rut? Not improving? Zone 2 training will transform your training
  and racing, making you a more resilient, happier and healthier runner.

  I rarely see fell runners training by heart rate. It seems actively looked
  down upon as many fell runners eschew the modern world of navigation and
  training methodologies in favour of the call of the wild. 


  I'm a fan of the wild :) I'm a fan of getting outdoors and just running. But I
  also love getting stronger, going faster for longer, and improving my race
  times. Heart rate based training has made me a better runner all round,
  specifically due to increasing my Zone 2 sessions.


  ## The Problem With Just Running


  Training without the guidance of a heart rate monitor means training blind.
  Most runners are unaware of the intensity they are running at and how long
  they are holding it for.


  In practice this means that fell runners train often at a level which is
  maintainable for 2 - 4 hours, what we can call tempo or Zone 3 running. It
  feels tough, it feels exciting, it can make you feel strong, but it will
  prevent you moving forward as a runner. It's called the 'dead zone' for a
  reason.


  Mixed in with this Zone 3 running are often bouts of easier running and rest
  stops to recover from the effort of running tempo. This leads to sessions with
  no clear focus on specific body systems to improve.


  Too much training in Zone 3 leads to fatigue, injury and a stagnation in
  racing times due to improper pacing and lack of aerobic endurance. When races
  come, it's very clear that 90% of the field start off too strong and get
  slower as the race goes on. 


  So how can we reverse this trend. Get faster as races go on, recover quickly
  from training, and get stronger to avoid injury.


  ## What is Zone 2?


  You can think of Zone 2 as an all day pace. You can keep a conversation. You
  can think straight. You can enjoy the view. 


  It is not easy. It is not a recovery run. It can feel hard, and as you get
  faster, will get harder. 


  In absolute terms it lies between 70% and 80% of your max heart rate. You can
  calculate your personalised heart rate zones with the running calculator I
  made to accompany these articles here. For me, with a max heart rate of 192,
  it lies between 134 and 153 bpm.


  ## The Benefits of Zone 2 Running


  Zone 2 training has its biggest effect on your metabolism. At this intensity
  you are able to burn fat rather than carbs as your main source of fuel. You
  only have enough carbs for 90 minutes of intense exercise. You have enough
  energy in your fat stores to last days. Improving your ability to burn fat
  means you have an extra energy store previously unavailable to you. Combined
  with fasted training (another article coming soon), it will change the way you
  feel, train, and race.


  It's not just fats though. Zone 2 intensity increases your muscle glycogen
  storage, which means you can store more carbs to go stronger for longer at
  higher intensities. It even improves your ability to clear lactate from your
  blood, essential for shorter efforts such as 10k distances. Your muscles also
  have an increased number of capillaries which improve your ability to process
  oxygen at all intensities.


  Your heart gets bigger. You have improved stroke volume and maximal cardiac
  output. This means you can push more blood around the body to deliver oxygen
  to your muscles.


  Higher intensity running clearly does the above too. But you can't do as much
  of it without burning out. This means Zone 2 training gives you more
  adaptation in the long run. Training in this zone will improve your ability to
  recover and manage fatigue, whilst still giving you the physiological stress
  to improve.


  Zone 2 training will improve your pacing and lower your heart rate across the
  board for all intensities. You will be able to push your faster sessions and
  go longer. You will get crowns on Strava!


  For racing you will find that you will be going much faster on the flatter and
  downhill sections, whilst still maintaining a high speed up hills. You will
  get faster, rather than slower as races progress. You will have more
  confidence in your ability. You will pass people you never thought you would.


  There is no better zone for maintaining positive mental health. When you run
  in Zone 3 your body is releasing a lot of adrenaline and cortisone as your
  body is pushed into a simulated fight / flight response. This can cause stress
  and anxiety and takes some time to recover and restore balance. Zone 2
  training leaves you pleasantly relaxed while still tired. 


  Your diet will change. You will no longer need those sweet things to keep your
  energy levels up as you will burn more fat in daily life. You won't need to
  eat for high intensity runs less than 2 hours. You won't need to eat at all
  for your long runs up to 3 hours. This diet change will lead to weight loss, a
  key in training and racing faster for free.
