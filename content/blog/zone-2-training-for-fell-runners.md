intro: >-
  Stuck in a rut? Not improving? Zone 2 training will transform your training
  and racing, making you a more resilient, happier and healthier runner.
main: >-
  I rarely see fell runners training by heart rate. It seems actively looked
  down upon as many fell runners eschew the modern world of navigation and
  training methodologies in favour of the call of the wild. 


  I'm a fan of the wild :smile: I'm a fan of getting outdoors and just running.
  But I also love getting stronger, going faster for longer, and improving my
  race times. Heart rate based training has made me a better runner all round,
  specifically due to increasing my Zone 2 sessions.


  ## The Problem With Just Running


  Training without the guidance of a heart rate monitor means training blind.
  Most runners are unaware of the intensity they are running at and how long
  they are holding it for.


  In practice this means that fell runners train often at a level which is
  maintainable for 2 - 4 hours, what we can call tempo or Zone 3 running. It
  feels tough, it feels exciting, it can make you feel strong, but it will
  prevent you moving forward as a runner. It's called the 'dead zone' for a
  reason.


  Mixed in with this Zone 3 running are often bouts of easier running and rest
  stops to recover from the effort of running tempo. This leads to sessions with
  no clear focus on specific body systems to improve.


  Too much training in Zone 3 leads to fatigue, injury and a stagnation in
  racing times due to improper pacing and lack of aerobic endurance. When races
  come, it's very clear that 90% of the field start off too strong and get
  slower as the race goes on. 


  Zone 2 sessions will reverse this trend. It will help you get faster as races
  go on, recover quickly from training, and become stronger to avoid injury.


  ## What is Zone 2?


  You can think of Zone 2 as an all day pace. You can keep a conversation. You
  can think straight. You can enjoy the view. 


  It is not easy. It is not a recovery run. It can feel hard, and as you get
  faster, will get harder. 


  In absolute terms it lies between 70% and 80% of your max heart rate. You can
  calculate your personalised heart rate zones with the [running calculator
  ](/calculator)I made to accompany these articles here. For me, with a max
  heart rate of 192, it lies between 134 and 153 bpm.


  ## The Benefits


  Zone 2 training has its biggest effect on your metabolism. At this intensity
  you are able to burn fat rather than carbs as your main source of fuel. You
  only have enough carbs for 90 minutes of intense exercise. You have enough
  energy in your fat stores to last days. Improving your ability to burn fat
  means you have an extra energy store previously unavailable to you. Combined
  with fasted training (another article coming soon), it will change the way you
  feel, train, and race.


  It's not just fats though. Zone 2 intensity increases your muscle glycogen
  storage, which means you can store more carbs to go stronger for longer at
  higher intensities. It even improves your ability to clear lactate from your
  blood, essential for shorter efforts such as 10k distances. Your muscles also
  have an increased number of capillaries which improve your ability to process
  oxygen at all intensities.


  Your heart gets bigger. You have improved stroke volume and maximal cardiac
  output. This means you can push more blood around the body to deliver oxygen
  to your muscles.


  Higher intensity running clearly does the above too. But you can't do as much
  of it without burning out. This means Zone 2 training gives you more
  adaptation in the long run. Training in this zone will improve your ability to
  recover and manage fatigue, whilst still giving you the physiological stress
  to improve.


  Zone 2 training will improve your pacing and lower your heart rate across the
  board for all intensities. You will be able to push your faster sessions and
  go longer. You will get crowns on Strava!


  For racing you will find that you will be going much faster on the flatter and
  downhill sections, whilst still maintaining a high speed up hills. You will
  get faster, rather than slower as races progress. You will have more
  confidence in your ability. You will pass people you never thought you would.


  There is no better zone for maintaining positive mental health. When you run
  in Zone 3 your body is releasing a lot of adrenaline and cortisone as your
  body is pushed into a simulated fight / flight response. This can cause stress
  and anxiety and takes some time to recover and restore balance. Zone 2
  training leaves you pleasantly relaxed while still tired. 


  Your diet will change. You will no longer need those sweet things to keep your
  energy levels up as you will burn more fat in daily life. You won't need to
  eat for high intensity runs less than 2 hours. You won't need to eat at all
  for your long runs up to 3 hours. This diet change will lead to weight loss, a
  key in training and racing faster for free.


  ## How to train in Zone 2?


  The first thing you need to do is work out your maximum heart rate. There are
  so many testing protocols for this but I find the easiest is to take a race of
  between 20 - 40 minutes where you worked as hard as you could, you weren't
  fatigued beforehand, and you sprinted to the finish line. Take the maximum
  value from that sprint at the end and it will be very close to your maximum.


  Next you need to work out your Zone 2 heart rate. You can do this using the
  calculator [here](/calculator). Just input your maximum heart rate and take
  the Zone 2 figures. 


  The difficult thing is then putting it into practice for your next run. You
  need to keep your heart rate somewhere between the upper and lower limits. It
  will definitely mean that you have to slow down drastically on any hill. It
  might mean you have to run faster on the flats and downs. 


  You have to keep the zone consistent. Any foray into the Zone 3 will cause a
  reset in the fat adaptation as your body switches to burning carbs. Any lower
  and you won't elicit enough stress to give benefits.


  I find the best way of doing this is to turn off all fields on my running
  watch so that I can only see heart rate. Then I can glance down occasionally
  as I run to check I'm in the right zone, forgetting pacing and distance
  metrics. This will feel annoying at first, but your body will adapt and you
  will begin to recognise when you are in Zone 2 and not need to look at all as
  you progress.


  You can also cross train effectively as you now have a standard to keep to. I
  do a lot of sessions on the bike, and I know that if I am in a Zone 2 session
  it's equivalent metabolically to doing it on a run.


  ## A balanced training schedule?


  Zone 2 training is not everything. It should be incorporated into a varied
  training routine that works other systems, depending on your targets in terms
  of training, racing, and lifestyle. I think the best place to start is to
  consciously replace those runs where your heart rate / intensity was in Zone
  3, with Zone 2 running. The goal is to provide stimulus for your body to
  adapt, and training in the 'dead zone' for most of your runs will not do
  this. 


  So you can still do your hill repeats and specifically targeted tempo runs.
  Just slow down on those runs which you used to get carried away on. 


  Some people have asked me about the quantity of Zone 2 training. I feel that
  in the beginning you should keep the same mileage and duration as before, just
  prevent yourself running in higher and lower zones for most of your running.
  You will soon find you can start to increase your mileage as your intensity is
  reduced. 


  ## Overcoming Zone 2 challenges


  There are a few challenges you will meet when you first begin targeting this
  zone.


  1. **You will have to walk on the hills**. This has the mental effect of
  making you not feel strong. We are playing the long game here, not satisfying
  our ego. Try and keep in mind that it will pay off in the weeks and months to
  come.

  uphill can be fun :)")


  2. **You will find it difficult to train with others**. Everyone has different
  abilities and training methods. You are going to find that you are further
  behind on shorter runs to begin with, and probably further ahead on longer
  runs feeling fresher while others bonk or exhaust themselves. If you run with
  a club, this gives you a really good opportunity to spend more time with the
  slower runners at the back, enjoying new conversations whilst keeping your own
  training intact.

  3. **The buzz isn't quite the same**. The after effect of a Zone 2 session is
  nothing like running in higher intensities. The buzz of adrenaline and
  exhaustion doesn't happen. Its a much more sedate training zone and will make
  you feel calm and collected. This can be tough if you enjoy beasting yourself
  in tempo mode and lying on the sofa afterwards!


  ## What can I expect?


  As your metabolism and neuromuscular system adapt to the lower intensity of
  training, there are some big changes that will come, albeit slowly. 


  Your pace in Zone 2 will increase. This means you will be running the same
  pace in Zone 2 as you used to in Zone 3. It will feel easier and you will be
  able to hold it for longer. As others around you are breathing heavily, you'll
  be ticking along knowing that you are training exactly as you need to. Zone 2
  pace will feel hard on your legs, but you'll be able to do it all day. 


  Your stamina and endurance will increase. You will have a better oxygen
  transport system and your ability to burn fats will improve. You'll speed up
  when others are slowing down towards the end of a race.


  You will be faster for the same heart rate at higher intensities. You used to
  run at 170bpm and feel quick, but you'll really feel strong now. You'll shock
  yourself, you'll feel like a faster runner.


  Your times in races will improve. In your Zone 2 sessions will get used to
  running an even intensity, over uneven terrain. Hills, flats, and downs are
  all run at the same intensity. It's well known that in fell races people slow
  down on the flats, but you'll keep going, overtaking others.


  ![You'll be faster downhill than you ever thought
  possible](/assets/67510809_10156380797971430_2018877728563920896_o.jpg "You'll
  be faster downhill than you ever thought possible")


  You'll recover quickly. You'll be ready for more intense sessions instead of
  being fatigued. You'll avoid injury. You'll keep consistent. 


  ## Why Zone 2 made me the runner I am today


  My training used to be characterised by tough runs that had me out of breath.
  I was trying to prove that I was quick, to myself, and to others. I was
  nervous of long distances, worried about fuelling on runs, and eating a lot of
  sugary foods.


  Last year I began Zone 2 training as the mainstay of my time outdoors,
  starting with 3 - 4 months of only Zone 2, and then building in other sessions
  around it as I got stronger.


  To begin with it was difficult. I felt so slow. I was walking up every hill. I
  felt like I was a slow runner. My pace on the flat at 145bpm was 9:00 minute
  miles. 


  As my pace evened out I noticed a few things. The first was that I was
  actually keeping up with people on the descents for the first time in my life.
  I was also faster on the flats than ever. 


  After 2 months I saw my pace dropping. 8:30 minute miles. Then 7:30 minute
  miles. I felt so strong and I was only going easy. Zone 2 began to feel hard.


  My heart rate was much lower in races. Not peaking in the 186bpm range it used
  to. 182bpm felt like practically sprinting, which means I could go stronger
  for longer and races didn't leave me as fatigued. I noticed I could race more
  often competitively, still recover, and get my other sessions done.


  Where am I at now? I can run 7:00 minute miles at 145bpm in Zone 2 on the
  flats. On hilly runs, I feel strong on all aspects of terrain. My core is
  stronger. I am confident in my own ability to hold different paces. I don't
  try and prove anything to anyone. I train at my own paces. I like running with
  slower runners. I run my own races and don't panic. 


  I'm really proud of where I've got to and the runner I am today. I hope this
  can be of benefit to other runners that are caught in the same trap of
  consistent tempo running. 


  Here's a picture of my winning ceremony at the lost Shepherd Fell race, where
  the field fell apart and I was able to keep going thanks to Zone 2 training.
