intro: "\U0001F3C6 1st Place - Perfect Long Run Pacing But More To Give \U0001F3C6"
main: >-
  This was my first 50k in 4 years. I had been quite nervous in the run up to
  the event and had been increasing my training load a lot.


  In terms of preparation I had been doing long runs for the 4 weeks leading up
  to the event. These were all around the 20 mile mark and 3 of them including
  elevations over 4500ft.


  I felt prepared mentally and physically to perform and it was quite a relief
  to be able to get to the start line and just execute my plan :) .


  ## The Route

  Trail Panoramic 50km Route")


  The route included a substantial flat section before the main climb. Then some
  rolling terrain until the final 7km to the finish on flat roads. 


  In order to prepare for this type of elevation profile I had been emulating
  the profile in my long runs, including flat sections before and after longer
  climbs. 


  The checkpoints were really close together which meant I didn't have to carry
  too much and I opted to take no water until the second checkpoint where I
  could fill up before the main climb. 


  I had worked out some rough timings and realised that I could run the whole
  race below 5 hours which then became the main goal. Rather than focusing on
  places, I just wanted to use this as 50k experience to build on for the
  future.


  ## The Race


  The start was so funny, everyone was absolutely freezing despite it being only
  9 degrees. Thai people, and also acclimatised English fell runners, can't deal
  with the cold very well. I had been training in 30 degree heat for the 6 weeks
  before and so I honestly was freezing cold. I guess it's good training for
  heading back to the UK in a few weeks :) .


  When we set off I had a plan of keeping my heart rate in my Zone 2 range, and
  so headed out at that pace. Within a km I found myself with over 100m of
  distance between myself and the second place runner and the gap was extending.
  I looked back and recognised Suki, a local coach and trail runner based in
  Chiang Mai. 


  I decided to change my race plan as I really didn't want to be running for 2.5
  hours in the dark by myself on unknown trails. I slowed down and started
  chatting to Suki and we ended up running together for the first 10 miles and
  having a good craic. 


  The night before a question was asked by a runner who had followed the route
  on his bicycle. 


  > "I followed the route yesterday and it led to a river, which had no way
  across. Is there a river crossing?"


  The organiser very comfortably replied.


  > "Mai Mee" - "There isn't"


  I couldn't believe it when we got to a river and had to cross up above our
  knees! I thought it was brilliant how he had kept a straight face. I'm not
  sure if he wanted it to be a surprise or that he was genuinely not sure :) .
  Anyhow it made for an entertaining few minutes. The picture on this post was
  taken at that river crossing.


  I could tell Suki wanted to win the race because he was pushing the pace a lot
  on the climbs, whereas I was just sticking to my Zone 2 which I can keep by
  feel now. So I would drop behind on the rolling terrain and just catch up
  after. In fact it was a real confidence boost for averaging my effort out
  correctly.

  We hit the start of the main climb. To be honest, I was quite cold because my
  heart rate was in the high 130s, which is recovery pace for me. I decided to
  just push up to my all day pace on the climb and see what happened. That's
  when I began to move away and realised that I should probably continue the
  effort for the rest of the race.


  I continued up the climb at a nice comfortable pace, a lot slower than the
  tempo efforts I had been doing in Chiang Mai in the buildup. Then some rolling
  terrain and the middle checkpoint at 20 miles. I felt really comfortable so
  ramped up the effort just a little and didn't walk any of the climbs from that
  point.


  I knew that at 25 miles I would hit the top of the main climb and so if I had
  some energy left I could smash it down that. The muscular endurance I had been
  building previously on big descents came into it's own and I let my legs fly.


  The last 4.5 miles were on road. Wowser, that was tough. Honestly I was
  pushing my muscles as hard as they could go, and I was only running 7:30
  minute miles. My body just didn't want to go any further. The last mile and my
  core started to cramp, which happened earlier in the year in the Manchester
  marathon. But it was a mile through the tourist are of Pai so I just kept
  going.

  Coming into the finish was funny. The race organised on the loudspeaker said: 


  > "Christopher Phillips, From The United States Of America, Champion of 50K"


  I had a quizzical look on my face as I came through, and I'm sure that the
  race finish photos will look really funny!


  ## Post Race


  After the race I made sure to eat lots of fruit and the white rice and
  omelette they were giving out. I had seen this from friends before in
  Thailand. The fruit is just great for replacing water lost and getting that
  anti-inflammatory action. The rice just replenishes those glycogen stores.
  Omelette handled the protein and after I had some really nice veggie food
  which Pai has in buckets.


  We then waited for a long time to receive the race trophy from the organisers.
  First it was 12, then 12:30 and finally around 1pm we were called to the
  stage.

  It was great to see that Suki had held on for 2nd place, comfortably ahead of
  everyone else. He's an upcoming talent in Thailand and I look forward to
  seeing more of his results and achievements in the future.


  ## Reflections


  Here are some thoughts after the race to consider moving forward:


  1. Nutrition - For me solid food will always be best. Sweet potatoes and mango
