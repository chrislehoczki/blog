  Find yourself losing time at the end of races? Fast uphill, slow on the flat,
  tired on the downs? Zone based training will make you a faster, stronger

  In my late twenties I was absolutely smashing it. Smashing it up a hill as
  hard as I could at the sharp end of the race. So good to be up there with
  these other powerful runners. 


  Then I wasn't. I was jogging on the tops. Fearing the downs, crushing my quads
  as my technique suffered and I fell apart. Walking the hills. Coming in half
  way down the field.


  Does this sound like a familiar story? 


  It doesn't have to be this way. With zone based training you can reverse this
  trend, ending stronger in races, overtaking those you thought you'd never
  catch.


  ## The Staple Training of A Fell Runner


  We love the hills. The overwhelming feeling of strength and resilience that
  comes from going uphill hard can't be matched. We like the suffering, of
  giving it your all and emptying the tank. Even if you don't like it, my guess
  is you're still attacking each hill out of habit, from what you've seen others
  do before you. That primal instinct to run with the pack, compete, is so
  strong.


  Out of breath, in the red, you reach the top. You stop for a while, take in
  the view, chat with your training partners. Then you dial it down a bit on the
  tops, feeling like you don't have the flat speed, after all, that's why you
  run on the fells right?


  The downhills come and you go down at a comfortable pace, don't want to get
  injured in training, and not worth blowing your quads out, again.....


  ## Whats Wrong Here?


  Actually, there is nothing wrong with this workout. It stresses various parts
  of our aerobic and neuromuscular systems, and as part of a structured and
  diverse training plan, can yield really impressive results. You'll feel tired
  and you'll get some adaptation from the overload of your system on those
  hills.


  The problem is in doing this repeatedly, for most of your sessions. It will
  lead to unnecessary fatigue which doesn't lead to improvement over time. 


  In order to see why, we have to look at the human body, our neuromuscular and
  metabolic systems that are used during exercise.


  ## What Are Those Zones Then?


  The first thing to note is that this soon gets complicated, so I'm going to
  simplify it down with what I use that I find helpful whilst training and
  racing and what I think is the most relevant for fell runners. This is the
  simplest way, based on max heart rate, but there are many methods out there.
  Here is an overview of the basic zones, heart rate, and durations:


  | Zone  | Description  | %HrMax | Duration  | My HR (max 192bpm) |

  |---|---|---|---|--- |

  |1| Active Recovery | < 70%  | All Day  | < 134 |

  |2| Endurance  | 70% - 80%  | 10 Hours  | 134 - 153 |

  |3| Tempo  | 80% - 88%  | 3 Hours  | 153 - 168 |

  |4| Lactate Threshold  | 88% - 95% | 1 Hour  | 168 - 182 |

  |5| VO2 Max  | 95% - 100% | 3-5 Minutes  | 182 - 192 |
